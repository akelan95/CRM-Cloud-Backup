## 🛠 Problem This Solves  
Most CRM providers offer **manual data backup services**, which are often **slow, inefficient, and limited**. Businesses relying on CRM systems frequently encounter the following challenges:  

1️⃣ **Limited Free Backups** – Many CRM providers allow only **one free backup per month**. If users need additional backups, they must **wait until the next month** or **pay for an urgent request**.  

2️⃣ **Time-Consuming Request Process** – To obtain a backup, users must often:  
   - Fill out a request form  
   - Wait for support teams to review and approve  
   - Have senior engineers manually generate and send the backup  
   - Download the backup manually and import it into a database  

3️⃣ **Risk of Data Loss** – If a user **modifies or enters new data** after a backup is created, they may lose access to recent records unless they **pay for an urgent backup**.
